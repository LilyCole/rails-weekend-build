# Rails Weekend Buid

In preparation for building an app from scratch in Rails, this week's only HW will be to build a CRUD app from the ground up. For this homework, you will build an app of your choosing.

If you don't have any ideas for projects, use the list of sample projects below.

If you have multiple ideas for project week, this may be a good opportunity to try one out. We would suggest not doing the same project over for project week, so you don't burn out.

## Requirements (MVP)
- Must have 2 models
- Must have 1 association between models
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least 1 model
- Include Error Handling & Validations for all models (try to break it!)

#### Stretch Goals
- User Authentication & Authorization
- 3 Models, a many-to-many association
- Tests
- Deployment

## Sample Project Ideas
If you're not sure where to start, try one of these groupings:

    Zoos, Animals, Caretakers
    BookClubs, Members, Events
    PropertyManagers, Properties, Tenants
    Stores, Items, Employees
    Nonprofit, Patrons, Donations
    SportsTeam, Players, Games
    Guests, Allergies, Potlucks
    Podcasts, Episodes, Listeners
